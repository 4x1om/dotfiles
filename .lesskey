#command

# Shift+J/K: J/K but 4 lines at a time
# This is accomplished by calling the forw-line action (which scrolls 1 line),
# and then an "extra" command of 3j. A weird workaround, but I haven't found
# anything else that works.
# See: man lesskey | grep \"extra\" --color=never -A4
J forw-line 3j
K back-line 3k

# Shift+H/L: J/K but half a screen at a time
H back-scroll
L forw-scroll
